Hello, thanks for come by. 

This is where I <s>always</s> sometimes post about some info that I spent bunch of hours but don't let others down and just save their time. And also "rm -rf ./my-useless-thoughts"

**What is your job?**<br/>
I'm working as a Software Engineer in [Polyga](https://www.polyga.com) which has small team but is very amazing company. I mostly unreveal my wide <s>but not a deep</s> knowledges of overall software techs to lots of projects.

**What are you on now**<br/>
I love Open Source. Not contributing a lot but trying to figure out how I can immerse into Open Source community a lot more. I participated [Hacktoberfest 2018](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com) too! Very enjoyed and got a lovely t-shirt.

And my life-time dream is to build up a strong skill to make my idea into real, which I think "Application" is the perfect for that. So [Flutter](https://github.com/flutter/flutter) is my on-going project. 

**What is your gear?**<br/>
Elementary OS & Windows dual-booting on ASUS ROG laptop.

Very love to share my ideas and experiences!
