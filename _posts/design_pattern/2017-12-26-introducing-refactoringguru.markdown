Not a commercial, but just wanted to introduce this site who is going to study **Design Pattern** with GoF, because I'm studying with this site and gonna post about my study notes on this blog :)

Well, I'm pretty sure it's hard to learn Design Pattern or Refactoring at normal school curriculum. There was only 'one' class which tried to cover static factory, builder pattern, singleton and adapter. But that was all. And I guess these theories are very related to real problems, huge size project or complex structures.

If students know some patterns and try to apply on their projects like capstone, would be ideal! However, time is limited and we still got so many things to learn. I think that's why school can't spend bunch of time to teach these important theories.

This site, [refactoring.guru](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns)(thanks to Alexander Shvets who is standing behind this site) is going to be a sweet-beginning oasis for newbies of Design Patterns and refactoring like me.

These theories are not easy to digest, not easy to apply and not easy to make yours. And this site will not be a perfect guide for you to get through the theories. But even without any step forward, we never can! That's why this site can be great chance to study them. GoF is still amazing and great book but if you got some basic knowledges before getting started, it would be huge help for you.

Happy <s>coding</s> Engineering!
