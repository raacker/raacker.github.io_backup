<h4>In my data science class,</h4>
one of the graduate students of my professor developed fitcraft, fitbit with minecraft. It is just same as actual minecraft game but in that server, players can earn resources via 'step data' of fitbit. Go work out for more stuffs! Quite cool idea as Pokemon Go does :)

But me and my gamer group(other two friends :) ) wanted our own server! To make diamond sword and pick to travel our world and dig into deeeeeeeep dark.

Our plan was as below.

1. Make Amazon EC2 ubuntu server.
2. Run Minecraft server java program that Mojang provides.
3. Enjoy it!

But as we, computer guys, always do in everyday, we had to face the problem. We wrote shell script to run it but when we close shell session, it also shutdown! Even if we ran it as a background process.

The answer was using **nohup**.

{% highlight text %}
nohup is a POSIX command to ignore the HUP (hangup) or SIGHUP signal. The HUP signal is, by convention, the way a terminal warns dependent processes of logout.

{% endhighlight %}
Reference : [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nohup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nohup)

In other words, not killed with SIGHUP signal, we can keep use our terminal and receive any info or output later.

Our server startup code was like this.

{% highlight bash %}
$ java -Xmx1024M -Xms2014M -jar minecraft_server.1.11.2.jar nogui
{% endhighlight %}

You can find this code on official website. [https://minecraft.net/en-us/download/server](https://minecraft.net/en-us/download/server)

And '&' symbol allows you to run task at background. So final server command will be

{% highlight bash %}
$ nohup java -Xmx1024M -Xms2014M -jar minecraft_server.1.11.2.jar nogui &
{% endhighlight %}

You can't find this process via single ps command.

use

{% highlight bash %}
$ ps -ef | grep nohup
{% endhighlight %}

the logs will be included in nohup.out in the same directory where your file located.

Happy mining! I actually died by spider a few hours ago... lost all diamonds....
