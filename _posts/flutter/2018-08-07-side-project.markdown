<h3>I've been collecting</h3>

all useful links into my Trello board, articles. Sometimes, pick some interesting subjects from the cards and write a post about it.

But googling a lot day by day, I could find a lot of materials and everything was useful!

Since then.. 'the cards' have been getting a lot of weight (almost one kilogram) and tons of URLs are spilled over my board now. I even can't remember what URL I putted and where to find it. My 'side project' has started from this idea, we are living in too-many-information era and we all cannot remember everything you want to read or reference.

So! I've been planning to make an service, Lingo(Link + GongYu(means 'Share' in Korean)), that give a chance to collect your useful links and manage them. Lingo will be a hybrid app and web app for next version, with google auth login and synchronize features.

Since I started learning React, I also had React Native in mind but I decided to use Flutter and make it open sourced project. Hope it to be a good reference of flutter projects and share good things over the world! If they need this kind of service :)

I will post progresses and stories of Lingo project.
