Flask is a micro web framework written in Python and based on the Werkzeug toolkit and Jinja2 template engine

(from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flask_(web_framework)))

Yes. Flask is python back-end framework, which is awesome, and one of major frameworks. I can see a lot of Django users but I prefer Flask (actually they are quite similar) because of this part,

```Flask is called a micro framework because it does not require particular tools or libraries. It has no database abstraction layer, form validation, or any other components where pre-existing third-party libraries provide common functions. However, Flask supports extensions that can add application features as if they were implemented in Flask itself.
```

Yes, Flask is really simple and light. It's easy to build, powerful to show great performance with simplicity. You can just use extensions whatever you need!

I met this framework in this April, 2017. I had to see how my company's web server works and it was Flask app. I didn't realize how it is amazing at the first glance :) but now, I'm working on a private Flask project and also going to do some personal projects to build back-end and also front-end, building website.

Since I'm studying Flask, I'd like to post my study notes and introduce you how much Flask is good at web server.

<br/>
I'm taking an Udemy course [REST APIs with Flask and Python](https://www.udemy.com/rest-api-flask-and-python). It's not about whole Flask app stuff but cover some basics and RESTful back-end server. So it worth to learn and I'm enjoying it. I might try to take [The Build a SAAS App with Flask Course](https://www.udemy.com/the-build-a-saas-app-with-flask-course) after this course.

Anyway, my following Flask posts will be based on some Online courses and materials, also including extra informations and links.
