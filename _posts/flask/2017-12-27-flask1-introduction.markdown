Flask is a micro web framework written in Python and based on the Werkzeug toolkit and Jinja2 template engine

Yes. Flask is python back-end framework, which is awesome, and one of major frameworks. I can see a lot of Django users but I prefer Flask (actually they are quite similar) because of this part,

```Flask is called a micro framework because it does not require particular tools or libraries. It has no database abstraction layer, form validation, or any other components where pre-existing third-party libraries provide common functions. However, Flask supports extensions that can add application features as if they were implemented in Flask itself.
```

Yes, Flask is really simple and light. It's easy to build, powerful to show great performance with simplicity. You can just use extensions whatever you need!

I met this framework in this April, 2017. I had to see how my company's web server works and it was Flask app. I didn't realize how it is amazing at the first glance :) but now, I'm working on a private Flask project and also going to do some personal projects to build back-end and also front-end, building website.

Since I'm studying Flask, I'd like to post my study notes and introduce you how much Flask is good at web server.
