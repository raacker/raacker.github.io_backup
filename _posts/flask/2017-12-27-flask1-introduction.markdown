<h3>Introduction</h3>

```
Flask is a micro web framework written in Python and based on the Werkzeug toolkit and Jinja2 template engine
```
(from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flask_(web_framework)))

Yes. Flask is python back-end framework, which is awesome, and one of major frameworks. I can see a lot of Django users but I prefer Flask (actually they are quite similar) because of this part,

```Flask is called a micro framework because it does not require particular tools or libraries. It has no database abstraction layer, form validation, or any other components where pre-existing third-party libraries provide common functions. However, Flask supports extensions that can add application features as if they were implemented in Flask itself.
```
(from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flask_(web_framework)))

Yes, Flask is really simple and light. It's easy to build, powerful to show great performance with simplicity. You can just use extensions whatever you need!

I met this framework in this April, 2017. I had to see how my company's web server works and it was Flask app. I didn't realize how it is amazing at the first glance :) but now, I'm working on a private Flask project and also going to do some personal projects to build back-end and also front-end, building website.

Since I'm studying Flask, I'd like to post my study notes and introduce you how much Flask is good at web server.

<br/>
I'm taking an Udemy course [REST APIs with Flask and Python](https://www.udemy.com/rest-api-flask-and-python). It's not about whole Flask app stuff but cover some basics and RESTful back-end server. So it worth to learn and I'm enjoying it. I might try to take [The Build a SAAS App with Flask Course](https://www.udemy.com/the-build-a-saas-app-with-flask-course) after this course. But I think every courses cover similar topics so just take only one course and try to study through other materials is enough.

Anyway, my following Flask posts will be based on some Online courses and materials, also including extra informations and links.
