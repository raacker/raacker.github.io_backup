**Dear diary,**

I have a partner in my company, EuiTaek. We are doing this amazing internship at the same company, NanoCellect.

Today, I was able to grab a chance to visit Illumina because my partner has a roommate! who is working at Illumina. So.. these are what I learned during this short tour, for 2 or 3 hours.

I've been struggling with my future. What I want to do, what I'm going to do, what actually I'm good at. Maybe because I'm senior now and going to graduate in a few months.

But as time goes by, I was focusing on what skills I got and which skills I can use to get a job. It was wrong. I've totally forgot what I learned from 'Randy Pausch', my first biggest inspiration. *"Fundamentals, Fundamentals, Fundamentals!".* If you don't know this quote, you should watch his ['last lecture'](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5_MqicxSo). Yes, I was trying to be a 'just just just developer', not a 'software engineer'. I'm pretty sure I'm lack of a lot of fundamentals knowledges of Computer Science and need more study! But I was just mad at getting a job, not being grown up and going further. It's time to go back, to the beginning, where all basic and totally basics are coming from.
