<h2>Not a time traveling story or reapplying to school.</h2> My sophomore was in Mar, 2015 to Feb, 2016. It was brilliant! Because I was just back to school from army(Korea) and I restarted all of my studies.

The story as a boilermaker for two months, Jan to Feb, gave me a lot of experience and made me a grown up. I had been struggling with finding my life-time area. Like... "oh you really love to learn hacking skills and kind of things! You will be a great hacker someday." That would be really nice fairy tale for me. Because he or she will enjoy the entire life with what the one really likes to do. But that is not a general story. Most of students always want to find what they really like and what they can enjoy, not a 'forced joy'.

I'm senior now. This is my last year as an university student and I should decide my next step. Maybe it could be already late to decide my next step. Though, I found a hope and believe, and just realized the fact! (not a general fact. Just for me or you too) <b>I don't have to choose what I'm gonna be after 10 years!</b> Imagining and hoping the future dream is totally important for every person. But that doesn't mean I should keep working on what I decided before. I can change or give up if I really want! If you understand this, you would feel chilling.

My conclusion with that big thought is just enjoy now, with doing what I like to enjoy and have fun with it. In other words, raspberry pi things and open source! Stunning things, right? :)

Okay, back to the first story, I decided to maintain my naive and stupid project I made before(actually stupid I'm sure. Because I wrote the code and algorithms). My best project was making an autonomous car with ultrasonic sensor. I bought all the parts of the car and structured and built the whole body. And wrote a silly code! I think it's time to have fun with my tiny old computer, two years buddy :)

I'll keep posting the story. It's totally been a while since I wrote a post. This lazy man is now on the way that would change the entire life, more funnier, more exciting and more valuable.
