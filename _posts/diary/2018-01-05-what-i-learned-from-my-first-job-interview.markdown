*I'd like to write down about my experience of my first job interview to share this kind of interview way and for reminding myself. If you are seeking for your first job and also graduate, hope this help you even a little bit.*

<h3>A few days ago,</h3>

I had a job interview with Japan E-commerce company, located in Tokyo, Japan. I would not write the company's name but I think you will be able to easily notice.

I applied through **LinkedIn**. It was a sudden and honestly I was not ready to take an interview. But what can I do! I had to get though this chance and here's what happened.

First part was coding test and video interview. Coding test was via [Codility](https://app.codility.com/programmers/), and video interview was via [HireVue](https://www.hirevue.com/). I think both way were fine. Codility was more than I thought and had some details which recruiters care a lot, including how the candidate starts the programming, plans test cases.. so on. And recoded video interview was totally new for me. Never heard about this before but I liked it! Just do a interview through any device, any place, any time you want :) even though I screwed it..

Here are what I want to remind you(including me) before taking an interview for the first time. I think these would be helpful even for your second or more of interviews.


<br/>**1) Coding : Understand what Problem want to solve**

This is the most hardest problem you will have but also it will be the easiest way to solve your question. No matter how long it takes(reasonable time though. You might not be able to code in 5 minutes), please take as much time as possible to understand completely. It will include What **problem is**, What problem **wants to solve**, What problem will **get for input** and What the **result would be like**.

That means if you don't spend enough time to understand the fundamental of problem, you will most likely to fail your problem. It's almost same as our Software development process, especially TDD. If you don't figure out what are you going to make or if you don't make enough and effective test cases, you must *waste* tons of time to change your code and the quality will always be bad. If you know the reason, I'm sure you agree with this.


<br/>**2) Coding : Think about time complexity but also don't miss space complexity too**

Time complexity would be regarded as most important part of your algorithm. Yes it's absolutely true. If your algorithm solves the problem within O(n^3), well done! it solves the problem. But with that algorithm, you might be scared of even only 100 input. Yes, most of test cases will try to catch corner cases and large input test also. You should find better way to solve it.

But that does not mean you can use 1000 * 1000 array for dynamic programming(If it is needed, space complexity limit will also cover it. Don't worry). Modern computers have enough disk and RAM for you but still, that does not mean you can waste your memory. Keep in mind, Space is not important than Time complexity, but that **doesn't mean it is not important**.


<br/>**3) Coding : Be careful with input range**

Yes, I was who didn't spend much time and made a mistake at the job interview. Input and output usually have range and min, max limit. And sometimes, the values seem obvious to have. Like reasonable input range. But just be a Sherlock Homes and be curious about everything, doubt everything. **Input value sometimes will be most important thing you have to care about**(for example, *integer* cannot handle huge value(2^32) than *long* type).


<br/>**4) Interview : Prepare your answers perfectly, but not sentences**

I think this is the most basic and you might already know this. When you have to prepare your project presentation or job interview, you have to think about what to tell, need to be prepared. But if you make a script, it won't help you at all. Keep your answers with **only keywords** and memorize and **do image training** with these words.

If you try to memorize scrips as actor or actress do, when you forgot the specific word or any part of important information, your head will just blow up. Totally erased and white papered memory. I'm sure you already have same experiences. The ideal solution will be using keywords! Then you don't have to memorize 100 or 200 words(it will be much more than this) and you can do your presentation or interview naturally, as you speak normally. Keyword, keyword, keyword. This will be only any only important thing you should mind.


<br/>**5) Other : LinkedIn will give you the best of the best way to find your next job**

If you don't have resume yet?('cause this is for newbies like me. I saw too many people who don't have resume yet or think they don't have any experience to write down. It's actually wrong. You know it ;p)

Then what about LinkedIn? LinkedIn has already been massive SNS for professionals and is getting bigger day by day! There are a lot of recruiters from many companies and also head hunters and your professor or friends or.. amazing people! If you don't have [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com) yet, just go right now and start making your account.

**You might find these links are helpful to prepare your interview.**

- [Codewars](www.codewars.com)

My favorite. It regards programming problems as Kata and kind of dojo.

- [Codeforces](codeforces.com)

Also I love this site. Codeforces holds regular competition like twice a week or more. And sometimes, some company sponsor the competition and winner can get prize.

- [Geeks for Geeks](https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/)

This site provides valuable resources to study and also categorized problems by company's style and actual test examples. Would be helpful if you are already familiar with programming challenges.

- [Baekjoon Online Judge](https://acmicpc.net)

If you are Korean, you might find this site is also useful. I don't like that they are using URL as ACM-ICPC but whatever. There are already tons of Korean people and a lot of resources too. If you want to intensively practice, also nice choice

- [Codility for programmers](https://app.codility.com/programmers/)

There is not many contents but still useful and you will find how online coding test looks like.

- [I interviewed at five top companies in Silicon Valley in five days, and luckily got five job offers](https://medium.com/@XiaohanZeng/i-interviewed-at-five-top-companies-in-silicon-valley-in-five-days-and-luckily-got-five-job-offers-25178cf74e0f)

This cool article is from who got all job offers from 5 top companies. He is not a newbie but still. It will be helpful.

- [CS Dojo Youtube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCxX9wt5FWQUAAz4UrysqK9A)

I just found this channel a few days ago. The guy is trying to make job interview prep videos and seems helpful. Try out.
