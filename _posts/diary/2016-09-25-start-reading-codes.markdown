<h4>Recently</h4>, I'm really into open source. I've been familiar with open source already but didn't have courage to meet them. Seems really difficult and not my level or area! But time by time, It became obvious that what I should do and what I can do better is open source projects and contribution on them. Just new beginning and still have small courages, trying to get deeply into it.

My first project is [neovim](https://github.com/neovim/neovim). I'm definitely sure you love it if you are really familiar with vim editor(I am A geek of vim actually). Trying to give a small step for every days. My dream is making this diary post to be hilarious and funny past memory.
