Since early last year, I've been using [Trello](https://trello.com/) as my memo note and personal project manager. Trello is well-known cardboard system. Many groups and companies are already using Trello as their project management tool and even for the individuals or small groups like study group or school assignment project teams are using it very well. And also, since it's on the Internet, you can use it everywhere! on your multiple devices!

In this post, I'd like to introduce how I'm using Trello for my projects.

**1. Project Management**

Self project management. Well, basically Trello is more powerful when you use it with your colleagues. But it's fine to use your own.

I got more than 6 boards that I keep maintaining right now. They are all for individual and personal projects. My blog's post list or [Glucosio android TODO list](https://trello.com/b/HuYMbJPn/glucosio-android) or.. just any project you are involed!

Just make 3 type of lists or more and just drag and drop to see your progress and keep track of your new ideas. See how your idea is realized easily. That's what cardboard system stands for, intuitive and easy to see!

**2. Kanban**

[Kanban(看板)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanban) is Japanese word meaning 'signboard or billboard'. It's kind of Agile process. We put stuffs to do in "TODO" and when it gets started, put in "In progress" and when it's done, put in "Done". Maybe we are already using this management principle at your office or any organizations. But what if you use this only for yourself?

You can make "Today's TODO" and "Tomorrow's TODO" to keep track of your daily plan and tomorrow's plan either. You can put all 'things to do' in "TODO list" and when it gets done, put them all in "DONE!" and feel the happiness of achievement!

**3. More than just using it**

Okay, let's say you got inspired and just started using Trello. But I'm pretty sure you want to see Trello board at your computer startup.

Just a few weeks ago, Trello.inc released [Trello desktop app](https://blog.trello.com/trello-desktop-app-for-mac-and-windows). You can install it at Windows 10 app store or Mac.

After you finished installation, **Press Ctrl + R** to open run prompt and type **shell:startup**.

Then it will open startup folder which Windows checks at the first time to open. Now open run prompt again and type **shell:AppsFolder**. Then you can see all the icons of your applications. Find the Trello icon and just drag it to startup folder! Now your Trello will always open at the start.

Also, you can choose default board. Now you got what you want to do.

Trello is cooperating with many of companies and it's still growing faster. I know you are already awesome but how it will be if you got an awesome tool on your right side? :)
