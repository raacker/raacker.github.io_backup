<p class="message">
  Greeting from South Korea! My Name is HeonGyeom Kim, Haven, a junior developer who is interested in Open source development, Linux, Python and love to do something fun with android and raspberry pi.
</p>

I'm majoring in Computer Science & Engineering and going to graduate next February. Currently, I'm in San Diego, CA for full-time Software Engineering internship at [NanoCellect Biomedical, Inc.](http://www.nanocellect.com/). I've been learning a lot and also met lots of amazing people and enjoying 'THE ACTUAL AMAZING' weather ;p

My most interest is open source. Not contributed on big projects yet but it is a kind of my life goal. I'm working on my personal development environment setting projects [setup_linux](https://github.com/raacker/setup_linux) and this blog for sharing my study notes.

Nowadays, I'm doing some back-end stuffs, like dreaming of Full-stack developer (I know, there are only few 'Genuine' full-stack developer. Just aiming to :) ). My projects are based on Flask and trying to add some React features too.

I really love to talk to people from other countries and meet them! This is why I always upload posts in English. I got amazing friends from other countries that we are still messaging each other everyday.

Feel free to contact me anytime!
