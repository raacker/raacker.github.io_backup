<p class="message">
  Greeting from South Korea! My Name is Heongyeom Kim. You can call me Haven.

  Open Source, Raspberry Pi, Vim and geek of Linux.
</p>

I'm majoring in Computer Science & Engineering in Korea. It's my last year of the university life. So excited but worried about my future too!

I really love to talk with people from other countries. That's why I've been doing penpal for more than 8 years. Love to use English and learn new cultures!

Mostly, I took a part of a leader in a group, even a single project team. I learned a lot of important things from that and I'm using it as my special skill.

My main linux distribution is [Linux Mint](https://www.linuxmint.com/).

Really love to make a funny things with my raspberry pi. It's like a upgraded Lego!

Feel free to help me out or ask me.
