<p class="message">
  Greeting from South Korea! My Name is Heongyeom Kim, Haven, a new-beginning programmer who is interested in Open source development, Linux, Python and love to do something fun with android and raspberry pi.
</p>

My major is Computer Science & Engineering and this year is my last year of University. Currently, I'm working as a full-time sw intern at [NanoCellect Biomedical, Inc.](http://www.nanocellect.com/), San Diego, CA.

I'm working on Android, Flask with postgresql and native java application of my company. Trying to learn something more that I've never met! and because my biggest interest is open source programs, keep trying to contribute on funny projects and make my own.

I really love to talk to people from other countries and meet them! This is why I always upload posts in English. I got amazing friends from other countries that we are still messaging each other everyday.

Feel free to contact me anytime!
