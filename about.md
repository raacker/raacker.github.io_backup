<p class="message">
  Greeting from South Korea! My Name is Heongyeom Kim. You can call me Haven.

  I can be represented with Open Source, Raspberry Pi, Automation system and geek of Linux.
</p>

I'm Korean and majoring in Computer Science & Engineering and this year is my last year of University. Soon I'm going to do my internship in San Diego from August! So excited. Check out my company's works [NanoCellect Biomedical, Inc.](http://www.nanocellect.com/)

My main field is software. It's really various but mostly android, java, python and sort of. I'm trying to experience as much as I can, including data processing and machine learning. My recent works are flask and postgresql web site, android application and data processing with python. It's some of my companies' works or my private projects or class project.

I really love to talk to people from other countries and meet them! This is why I always upload posts in English. I have a few friends from other countries and still messaging each other everyday.

Feel free to contact me anytime!
